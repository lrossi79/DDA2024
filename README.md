# DDA2024
Notebook for the course Digital Data Analysis at the IT University of Copenhagen

From the course description:

Every digital service leaves tons of data that, when analysed, can reveal important insights about the users as well as about the services they are using. Unfortunately, these data are not produced to answer specific questions - such as the case with surveys or experiments - but are the byproduct of users' activity. To untap the full potential of users' data we need to understand both  how to ask relevant questions and how to answer those questions with the data available. 

The course will cover the following areas: 

1) Digital data types, format and structure & Data wrangling with PANDAS

3) Data visualization

4) Understanding behavioral data and formulating hypothesis

5) Analysis of unstructured text data

6) Analysis of network data"
